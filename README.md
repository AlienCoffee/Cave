### Quick start

> Game requires **Java 14+**

Compiled versions of server and client on [google drive](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1HlniVBdQKjTPNwMjMdjH0uqbuJaOs1ZR?usp=sharing)

> **Versions are compiled for Windows.** Due to JavaFX uses native graphics implementation in libraries, players on _Linux_ and _Mac OS_ will need to replace `<classifier>win</classifier>` to `linux` or `mac` in `pom.xml` and package project on your own. Sorry for the inconvenience.

Official server is hosted and run on [shemplo.ru](https://shemplo.ru).

### Control

**Move** to neighbor tile: `W`, `A`, `S`, `D`  

**Activate/deactivate** tumbler: `Enter`

**Confirm** exit from the cave: `E`

Maze looks like a tiled field with passages on sides. Some of passages are absent at all. Some of passages can be closed with gates.
